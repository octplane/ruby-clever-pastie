%h1 About

UU was born out of the need to have a simple paste tool that automaticaly syntax highlight its content.

%h1 But this is not really a secure tool !

Not Really. It will locally encrypt the data using the provided key in the url but there is absolutely no
warranty somebody is not going to play the Man in the Middle to get the key and your pasted content. Encryption
is only performed to ensure that accessing the server's disk will not provide your paste content. To some extent.
